# Movie Dataset ML Project (Top 10,000 Movies)

This repository contains a complete **data analysis + machine learning** workflow using the `Top_10000_Movies.csv` dataset.
It covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training/evaluating ML models.

## What This Project Does

- **Data audit & cleaning**: standardizes columns, fixes types, handles missing values, removes duplicates.
- **EDA**: descriptive statistics + plots (distributions, correlations, group-by analysis).
- **ML (lab-style)**:
  - **Classification**: predicts a *high engagement* label (based on high vote count) using models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and KNN (in the lab-style notebook).
  - **Regression**: predicts a numeric target (preferably revenue/votes; linear regression is included in the lab-style notebook).
- **Artifacts**: saves cleaned datasets, tables, and figures to artifact folders.

## Repository Contents

Key files:
- `Ml_Project_LabStyle_Redo.ipynb` — main “lab-style” notebook (cleaning → EDA → ML).
- `Ml_Project.ipynb` — main notebook used by the local runner script.
- `run_notebook_local.py` — executes `Ml_Project.ipynb` and writes `Ml_Project.executed.ipynb`.
- `build_submission.py` — builds deliverables (figures, PDF report, ZIP) from the CSV.
- `download_dataset.py` — template script for recreating the dataset via an API (requires `TMDB_API_KEY`).

Datasets:
- `Top_10000_Movies.csv` — input dataset used by notebooks/scripts.

Outputs (already included / regenerated by scripts):
- `figures/` — PNG figures generated by `build_submission.py`.
- `labstyle_artifacts/` — cleaned CSV + figures + tables produced by the lab-style notebook.
- `Final_Report.pdf` — generated report (from `build_submission.py`).
- `Submission_Package.zip` — generated submission ZIP (from `build_submission.py`).

## Setup

### 1) Create a virtual environment (recommended)

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2) Install dependencies

This project uses common data science libraries. Install what you need with:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nbformat nbclient
```

## How to Run

### Option A — Run the main notebook automatically

This executes `Ml_Project.ipynb` and saves an executed copy:

```bash
python run_notebook_local.py
```

Output:
- `Ml_Project.executed.ipynb`

### Option B — Build submission deliverables (figures + PDF + ZIP)

```bash
python build_submission.py
```

Outputs:
- `figures/*.png`
- `Final_Report.pdf`
- `Submission_Package.zip`

### Option C — Open and run the lab-style notebook

Open `Ml_Project_LabStyle_Redo.ipynb` in Jupyter/VS Code and run cells from top to bottom.

Outputs are written under:
- `labstyle_artifacts/`

## Dataset Recreation (Optional)

If your course requires a “download/recreate dataset” script:

- `download_dataset.py` is a **template**.
- It expects an environment variable `TMDB_API_KEY`.

Example (PowerShell):

```bash
$env:TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY"
python download_dataset.py
```

> Note: the script intentionally stops with a message because API calls/pagination are provider-specific.

## Notes

- The project uses a fixed random seed (`RANDOM_STATE = 42`) for reproducibility.
- If you move files around, keep the dataset file name as `Top_10000_Movies.csv` in the repo root.
